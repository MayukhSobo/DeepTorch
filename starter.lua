-- all numbers in Lua is 64 bit floats

-- We can operate mathematically on all numbers

-- Lua has advanced math function avaialable with math module

print(math.abs(5 -7))
print(math.tan(45))
print(math.pi) -- number have precision of upto 13 digits

-- strings

s1 = 'Hello World!!'
s2 = "Hello World Again!!"

-- Concatinate strings

print(s1 .. ' ' .. s2)

-- Long strings, also preserves the new lines

longString = [[ This is
a long long
srting ]]

print('\n' .. longString)

-- By default any undefined variable would have nil value

print(k) -- prints nil because k is undefined

-- We can assign value of a variable to nil to delete it from memory
longString = nil
print(longString)

-- To see and verify if ```longString``` is deleted or not
-- we have a function called ```who()``` which prints all the
-- active variable in program memory while is is called

---  who()

-- who() doesn't work in a lua script but it works on
-- torch's interactive REPL
